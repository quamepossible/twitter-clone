# twitter-clone

Hi, 

I'm building a twitter clone from scratch using React.

I'll integrate it with a backend later on, but for now, I'm just working on the frontend and also adding the functionalities.

I'll really appreciate any help and/or recommendations.

<b>NB: Currently working on Home and Profile routes, rest of routes will return 404</b>
